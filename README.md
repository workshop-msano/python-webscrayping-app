[![Python Web Scraping](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-Web%20Scraping-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/workshop-msano/python-webscrayping-app)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/workshop-msano/python-webscrayping-app?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

This is a Python application that demonstrates web scraping techniques using AWS Lambda and the AWS Toolkit for VSCode. It provides a flexible framework for scraping web pages, parsing data, and leveraging AWS serverless functions for scalable web scraping.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/workshop-msano/python-webscrayping-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd python-webscrayping-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   <br/><sub>Creating a virtual environment is strongly recommended.</sub>

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following tools installed and configured:

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [SAM CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/)

### Virtual Environment

It is strongly recommended to set up a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Follow the appropriate instructions for your preferred virtual environment tool (e.g., `virtualenv` or `conda`) to create and activate a virtual environment for the project.

## Usage

### Customize the Scraping Logic

Open the `scraper.py` file and modify the code to define the specific web scraping rules based on your requirements.

### Set up AWS Lambda

Follow the AWS documentation to create an AWS Lambda function and configure the necessary permissions and triggers.

### Configure AWS Credentials

Install the [AWS Toolkit for VSCode](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudiocode/) and set up your AWS credentials using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) or VSCode's integrated AWS credentials management.

### Build and Test

To build the application locally and test it:

```shell
sam build
sam local invoke
```

### Deploy the Application to AWS Lambda

To deploy the application to AWS Lambda:

```shell
sam deploy --guided
```

This will also create a `samconfig.toml` file that contains the deployment configurations. For subsequent deployments, simply run `sam deploy` to deploy the app.

### Monitor the Execution and Results

Check the AWS CloudWatch logs and the output generated by the Lambda function to view the scraped data.
